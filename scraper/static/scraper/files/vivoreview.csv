66,Mukesh Kumar,5,Simply awesome,Good Quality
67,Puneet Gupta,3.4,Horrible,"It is a fake product... I matched it with my dad's earphones that we bought.

1. The wire used is relatively light than the actual ones.
2. The protection grill is cheaply pasted via glue that will come out at any point in time, while actual ones has a more sophisticated grill present.
3. Sound in the left ear piece is higher than the right one. This only comes into picture post 2-4 months of use

If you are in extreme constraints of budget and time, go for this one."
